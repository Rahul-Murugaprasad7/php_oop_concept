1. Data in URL:

The data sent using the GET method is appended to the URL as query parameters. This makes it visible in the address bar of the browser.
Example: http://example.com/page.php?name=John&age=25

2. Bookmarkable URLs:

Since the data is in the URL, URLs generated using the GET method are often bookmarkable. Users can save and share these URLs.

3. Caching:

GET requests can be cached by browsers, proxies, and other intermediate devices. Subsequent requests with the same URL may retrieve the cached response, improving performance.

4. Idempotent Operations:

GET requests are considered idempotent, meaning that multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request. They retrieve information without causing any side effects.

5. Simple Form Data:

GET is commonly used for simple form submissions where the amount of data is small and doesn't involve sensitive information.
However, it's important to note that using GET for certain operations may have security implications:

6. Security Concerns:

Since data is appended to the URL, it becomes visible and can be logged by web servers, browser history, and potentially exposed in other ways.
Use caution when dealing with sensitive data or when performing operations that modify server state, as it may be exposed in various logs.
