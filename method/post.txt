In the context of web development, 
the insertRecord method you provided is likely intended to handle the insertion of new records into a database table, 
specifically the "employee" table. The method expects the data to be provided through the $_POST superglobal, 
which is commonly used to retrieve form data submitted through an HTTP POST request.

Here's a breakdown of why $_POST is used in this method:

1. Form Data Submission:

The method is designed to handle form submissions where data is sent to the server using the HTTP POST method.

2. $_POST Superglobal:

$_POST is an associative array in PHP that holds data sent to the server using the POST method. It is often used to retrieve form data.
In the provided code, $post is a parameter representing data sent through the POST request.

3. Form Fields:

The method expects form fields named 'emp_name', 'occupation', and 'salary' to be present in the submitted data.

4. Data Extraction:

The values for 'emp_name', 'occupation', and 'salary' are extracted from the $post array.

Example:

php
Copy code
$name = $post['emp_name'];
$occupation = $post['occupation'];
$salary = $post['salary'];

5. SQL Query:

The extracted data is then used to construct an SQL INSERT query, inserting a new record into the "employee" table.

6. Error Handling:

The $result variable is used to check the success of the query execution.
If the query is successful ($result is truthy), the user is redirected to 'index.php' with a success message.
If there's an error, an error message is echoed, including the SQL query and details of the database connection error.

7. Header Redirect:

After successfully inserting a record, a header('location:index.php?msg=ins'); 
statement is used to redirect the user to 'index.php' with a query parameter indicating a successful insertion (msg=ins).

In summary, the insertRecord method is structured to handle form submissions containing employee data, 
typically submitted through an HTML form with the HTTP POST method. 
The use of $_POST allows the method to access the form data and process it for insertion into the database.
